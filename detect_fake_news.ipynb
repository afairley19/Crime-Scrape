It’s only because Hillary Clinton is losing that she is lobbing conspiracy theory. Citizen Quasar The way I see it, one of two things will happen: 1. Trump will win by a landslide but the election will be stolen via electronic voting, just like I have been predicting for over a decade, and the American People will accept the skewed election results just like they accept the TSA into their crotches. 2. Somebody will bust a cap in Hillary’s @$$ killing her and the election will be postponed. Follow AMTV!\"\"\",\n",

Most people can name every mascot of most companies, but they can not name hardly any historical figures. How did we get here?

Gold and silver in actual purchasing power will also rise. They won’t be saying an ounce of gold bought a good suit 100 years ago and an ounce of gold will buy a good suit now. That’s going to change, and it’s also going to change radically with silver .

Soon after McConnell's remarks, 42 Democrats again filibustered the resolution, preventing it from getting the 60 votes needed to advance.\"My strong preference is for Democrats to simply allow an up-or-down vote on the president's Iran deal.\" McConnell said. \"But if they're determined to make that impossible, then at the very least we should be able to provide some protection to Israel and long-overdue relief to Americans who've languished in Iranian custody for years.
